Every day we hear the word "success" in dialogs of two men when they speak about businessmen, from advertising of new parfume, where one of the richest persons on the planet tells us that you will definitely become successful, when you buy this parfume. So our society had the impression that success is about money and wealth. It has become a norm to say that if you have a million of dollars and a lot of fans you are successful. But in truth..The great amount of money gives you opportunity to buy luxury things, not to be happy. A great number of fans lead to lack of personal space, not to feeling of proud. Success is just a moment, when you are satisfied with your results. Many people will argue, because they are absolutely sure that you can succeed in a sphere and reap the benefits of your success all the rest life. But if you are ambitious person, reaching the goal will lead only to setting new target, not to lying on the sofa admiring your achievements. Success is not a life-long hard work. It is a second when you understand that you do that you want, you are where you want and you are with whom you want. But it is just a second. The next one will bring doubt and you personal vicious cycle will never be broken.
